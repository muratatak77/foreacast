# README

In this project, I was only able to focus on the background. I gave importance to code readability and testability.

When I started focusing on the front side, unfortunately I got some weird webpacker errors and I didn't have time to fix them.

After running the project, just calling the url is enough for the program to run.

Since there is no cache at first, a 404 - warning message will appear.

like : 
```
http://localhost:3000/api/forecasts?address=1775 Milmont Dr, Milpitas, 95035

```

If you try again after 1-2 seconds, you can see the results. As I said I was only able to return a json.
